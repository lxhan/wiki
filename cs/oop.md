## Classical inheritance

- Classes are immutable. You can't modify or add new methods to them at runtime.
- Classes may or may not support multiple inheritance.
- Abstrac classes, final classes, interfaces etc.

## Prototypal inheritance

- Prototypes are flexible. They may be either mutable or immutable.
- Objects can inherit from multiple prototypes.
- Objects only and extending objects is the only operation required.
